# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

The challenges have really been that, challenging. I came into mod0 with no coding and now I might not be the best but I can 100% say that I can code which is a huge step in the direction I want to be going. With my BS degree in stem research is a very normal thing so that didn't bother me at all, it is just intimidating how much information there is and how dynamic code writing can be. I always enjoy a challenge and I look forward to more :)

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow has been improving, for me my biggest thing has been taking breaks which I do feel like I have been getting better at. I am lucky enough to have a nice set up that is comfortable and quiet so I can focus. As I continue to learn I will continue to adjust to best fit my situation.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

Having teammates and teachers plus some good ole Googling is all that I think I need to be successful. When in a learning environment it is nice to be able to work together with others and bounce ideas off each other.
